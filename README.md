# Visonic Alarm Panel for Home Assistant

A Custom Integration for Home Assistant

## Introduction
Visonic produce the Powermax and Powermaster alarm panel series including (PowerMax+, PowerMaxExpress, PowerMaxPro and PowerMaxComplete, PowerMaster 10, PowerMaster30 and PowerMaster 33).

This Home Assistant Integration allows you to control the alarm panel (arm/disarm) and allows you to use the Visonic sensors and events (movement, door contact, ...) and X10 devices within Home Assistant.

Please note that after extensive work, the original PowerMax Panel is not able to be used as it does not support the Powerlink protocol that this component relies on. 

Also the Visonic 360R Alarm Panel is not fitted with an RS232 connection and cannot have a Powerlink3 fitted, it is therefore not compatible with this HA Component.
